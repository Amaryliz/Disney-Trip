      When you're planning the perfect Disney vacation there's a lot of thought
      has to go into EVERY detail, especially when it comes to picking which
      hotel to stay in and when it's best to purchase tickets.
    </p>

    <h2>Hotels:</h2>
    <p>
      In Orlando Disney has over 20 hotels that you can choose from, which can
      make choosing difficult! But we can narrow down our scope and choose the
      perfect option for us by looking at the different categories of hotels
      that Disney offers; Value, Moderate, and Deluxe Resorts
    </p>

    <h3>Value Resorts</h3>

    <p class="hotel">
      Value Resorts are the PERFECT option if you are having a family vacation
      with childern and you're on a budget. The Value Resorts typically range
      $100-$200 a night, which is prefect if you're on a budget, and the hotels
      are decorated with characters! They also have food court dining, which is
      kinda like cafeteria style so it's the perfect grab and go for a busy
      family. There are some downsides to staying at Value resorts, one of them
      being that in order to get to the parks you have to wait 10-20 minutes for
      the bus to pick you up to take you to the parks if you dont have a car.
      Also, there's NO waterslides!!

    </div>
    <h3>Moderate Resorts:</h3>

    <p class="hotel">
      Going higher on the list we have Moderate Resorts. So these resorts are a
      bit more pricey and range between $200-$300 a night, and they have a bit
      of luxury to them. The rooms are a little bigger than the value rooms, and
      they have king size bed options. These resorts also have BOTH food court
      and table service!! So if one day you're in the mood to sit down and enjoy
      a glass of wine you can. To top it off theres WATERSLIDES!!! But just like
      Value Resorts the only way to get to the parks is by bus. Unless you stay
      at the Port Orleans Riverside or French Quarter you can get a water taxi!!

    <h3>Deluxe Resorts:</h3>

    <p class="hotel">
      Lastly we have the Deluxe Resorts! These bad boys have a price tag of
      $350-$700 a night, but the luxury maybe worth it for some. The rooms are
      big and make you feel like you have been whisked off to somewhere far
      away. Your food options here are food court, table service, OR Character
      Dining, breakfast with Mickey!! Also, there's extra amenities such as
      on-site gyms, salons, valet parking, and some resorts have kid activity
      centers! As for transportaion you have multiple options on how to get to
      the parks- boats, bus, monorail, or even walking.
