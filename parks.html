      I dont think that choosing which park you want to go to is difficult, but
      knowing how to navigate is a different story. So, I'm going to give some
      tips and tricks to make walking around the parks bareable.

      The biggest tip I can give to anyone is DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON WATER
      BOTTLES!! The reasons that I say this is because One they're OVER priced
      and two you can get a free water cup from any resturant at the parks. So
      save that money!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My second tip is don't waste money on the park hopper pass. I just think
      it's a waste of money, because it's hard to enjoy an entire park in just
      one day so imagine trying to enjoy two. Also, if you're planning a Disney
      trip for a couple of days you'll most likely be going to the parks every
      day.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Another extra that I would skip out on would be the line hopper pass, but
      only during certain seasons. During peak seasons like summer and winter
      break the line hopper is useful. But during slow season you really don't
      need it, because Disney actually allows you to reserve three rides to skip
      the line at certain times. So why pay for something that you can get for
      free?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The last tip is BE COMFORTABLE! Wear comfy shoes and clothes, because you
      are going to be walking around a big ole Disney park for over 8 hours. I
      promise you will not last in flats!
